# Changelog

All notable changes to the pythonwhat project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.18.1

### Fixed

- Local setup with `setup_state` now works correctly (e.g. when the PEC contains a list comprehension)

## 2.18.0

- Add optional `force_diagnose` parameter to `test_exercise` to force passing the `diagnose` tests in `check_correct`.

## 2.17.2

### Improved

Documentation has been improved significantly (hopefully):

- Every 'compound statement check' has an example with explanation in the reference now.
- Common usecases have additional examples
- Checking compound statements article has been simplified, limits to context now.
- More helpful message in case check_object or has_printout not called on root state
- More helpful message in case the zoomed in on object is not an AST
- Explain has_equal_value vs has_equal_ast
- Get rid of some articles in favor of more fleshed out reference documentation

### Fixed

- CI is now using the `datacamp` account on PyPi

## 2.17.1

### Fixed

- Tuples of Numpy arrays can now be checked properly.

### Removed

- Code in `ObjectAssignmentParser` that is not used.

## 2.17.0

### Added

- Function `has_no_error()` to check earlier on whether the student did not generate any errors.

### Improved

- Messaging between V1 and V2 is entirely consistent now.
- No need for `__JINJA__` prefix in custom messages specified in SCTs anymore.

### Removed

- No more support for `expand_message` argument in old 'node checking functions' such as `test_for_loop()`.

## 2.16.2

### Added

- Ability to check class definitions with ``check_class_def()`` (and ``check_bases()``). Tested and documented.

## 2.16.1

### Changed

- The `check_object()` only on root check is only done if `PYTHONWHAT_V2_ONLY` environment variable is set.

### Added

- More checks that guard against commonly made mistakes (some in v2 only, others not)

## 2.16.0

### Added

- Function documentation (with examples) for `multi()`, `check_or()`, `check_correct()` and `check_not()`

### Changed

- If an SCT is incorrectly coded, it will generate more easily understandable errors so the author can easily fix the issue.
- If an SCT correctly runs but does not make a lot of sense, easily understanble errors will be thrown so the author can make improvements.

## 2.15.3

### Added

- `check_object()` does not check whether the targeted object is specified in the solution process if
  student and solution process are identical (as is the case in the `SingleProcessExercise`).
- `has_expr()`, the function used by `has_equal_value()`, `has_equal_output()` and `has_equal_error()` can take an `override` argument,
  that causes the solution expression _not_ to run and use the value specified in `override` instead.
  For more information, have a look at the 'SingleProcessExercise' article on the documentation.

## 2.15.2

### Removed

- `call()` can no longer be used. Use `Ex().check_function_def().check_call().has_equal_x()` instead.
- `has_key()` and `has_equal_key()` can no longer be used. Use `Ex().check_object().check_keys().has_equal_x()` instead.

## 2.15.1

- Fixed: `check_keys()` allows for more exotic ways of indexing as well, even though it's needed very rarely

## 2.15.0

### Added

- You can now use `Ex().check_object('df').check_keys('a').has_equal_value()` to test DataFrame columns and dictionary elements.
- You can now use `Ex().check_function_def('my_fun').check_call('f(1,3,4)').has_equal_x()` to check the value, output or error that calling a function generates. Soon, the `call()` syntax, although still supported, will be removed.
- More manual signatures have been added for functions in the `numpy.random` submodule, so SCT authors have to specify `signature=False` less and there is more robust argument matching.

### Changed

- Update docs to promote new functions introduced above.
- Messaging has improved: if there is crazy nesting, only the last two 'expand messages' are included. That way, you don't get feedback messages like "Check the first for loop. Check the body. Check the first for loop. Check the body. Check the function. ...".
- The function parser (used by `check_function()`) now also discovers function calls in lists and dictionaries.
- `has_import()` is now more flexible by default, not requiring students to use the same alias.

### Removed

- Nothing for now, but the following functions will be discontinued in the future:
  + `test_function_definition()`
  + `test_with()`
  + `test_object_after_expression()`
  + `has_key()` and `has_equal_key()`
  + `call()`

## 2.14.2

- Add `check_df()` to the API again. Turns out quite a lot of live exercises use it by now!

## 2.14.1

- Fix issue in `test_data_frame()` if message is not specified.
- Improve messaging in `has_key()` and `has_equal_key()`.

## 2.14.0

### Changed

- If `PYTHONWHAT_V2_ONLY = '1'` is set as an environment variable, you can no longer use _any_ of the `test_` functions.
  + Instead of `Ex().test_or(...)`, you have to use `Ex().check_or(...)`.
  + Instead of `Ex().test_correct(...)`, you have to use `Ex().check_correct(...)`.
  + Instead of `test_mc()`, you have to use `Ex().has_chosen()`.
  Docs have been updated accordingly.
- The package structure has been updated significantly
  + Distributing nearly all new functions over `check_funcs.py`, `has_funcs.py` and `check_logic.py`.
  + Grouping all old functions to test compound statements.
  + Moving around and rewriting tests to use `pytest` more and be more readable overall.

### Fixed

- `test_not()`'s functionality was tested more and bugs that appeared were fixed.
  It was nowhere used, so it was removed from the API in favor for `check_not()`, which has the same functionality.

### Removed

- `extend()` can not be used anymore.
- `check_df()` can not be used anymore. UPDATE: added again in 2.14.2.

## 2.13.2

### Changed

- The documentation pages have undergone significant maintenance.
  + There is now a tutorial that gradually exposes you to `pythonwhat`.
  + The articles have been brushed up to include more examples and more involved examples.
  + The articles have been split up into basic and advanced articles to make it clear what is most important.
  + `test_correct()` as a tool to add robustness is now featured more prominently

### Fixed

- `set_context()` can now be used to specify arguments either by position, either by name, making it a great tool for flexible checking.
- For `has_equal_output()`, the message that was generated didn't always make sense. That is fixed now.
- Highlighting was removed in an SCT chain when `set_context()` was used. This is no longer the case.
- Small fixes for bugs that should not have impacted students in the first place.

## 2.13.1

_Small changes to follow up on `2.13.0`_

- Get rid of `typestr` argument in `check_function()` as it's used nowhere
- Change the internals of has_printout, to be more allowing for different ways of doing things
- Improve variable names for readability and understanding

## 2.13.0

### Changed

- `test_function()` and `test_function_v2()` now use `check_function()` and `check_args()` behind the scenes.
  That way, when we make improvements to the messaging logic, all SCTs that use any of these three functions will benefit from them.
  In the future, we will deprecate `test_function()` and `test_function_v2()` as they are not explicit enough about what is being tested and how.
- `test_function('print')` and `check_function('print')` use `Ex().has_printout()` behind the scenes when appropriate.
  This makes the SCTs much more accepting for different ways of doing printouts.
- You can now use `check_finalbody()` to check the `finally` part of a `try-except` block.
- Drastically improve `has_equal_ast()` messaging.
- If you manually specify `code` argument in `has_equal_ast()`, you _have_ to specify the `incorrect_msg` because the machine-generated one will be meaningless (for now).

### Fixed

- **BIG ONE**: You can now test method calls that have subscripts in them.
  This is particularly useful for `pandas`, where you for example want to test a call `df[df.b == 'x'].a.sum()`.
  You can now do that with:

  ```python
  # Check whether the function was called:
  Ex().check_function('df.a.sum', signature=False)
  # Check whether the function was called and generated the correct result:
  Ex().check_function('df.a.sum', signature=False).has_equal_value()
  ```

  This update means that you should no longer need to use two `has_equal_ast()`'s inside a `test_correct()` to allow for two
  different ways of doing a pandas operation. If you do, please create an issue!

- Some fixes to `has_printout()` that caused it not to work in all cases.
- `check_function()` now refers to a function call in the way that the student defined it.
  When a student uses `import pandas as pd` and then has to call a function `pd.Series()`,
  `check_function()` will refer to the function with `pd.Series()` and not `pandas.Series()`.

### Removed

- `test_dict_comp()`, `test_try_except()`, `test_generator_exp()` and `test_lambda_function()` have been removed from the API.
  The couple of SCTs on DataCamp that used these functions have been converted to use the modern `check_` functions.

## 2.12.6

### Changed

- **If manually specifying `incorrect_msg` in has_equal_x: do not prepend previously generated messages. You no longer have to set `expand_msg = ""`.**

- Overall, improvement of automaticlaly generated messages:
  + Bite-size messages that are pasted together
  + More meaningful defaults that help (see `tests/test_messaging.py`)
  + Get rid of default-generated messages scattered all over the place
  + Better description of arguments
  + Better description of calls
  + Get rid of `has_key()` and `has_equal_key()` docs, as they will be phased out
  + Improved handling of getting results, output and values from process
  + Simplify old `test_expression_x()` functions and group in one file

## 2.12.4

### Added

- You can now robustly test printouts with `Ex().has_printout(index = x)`. This function will look for the `x`'th `print()` call in the solution code, rerun that call while capturing the output, and then look for that output in the output that was generated by the student's code submission.

  ```python
  Ex().has_printout(index=0)
  ```

  This approach is far easier and more robust than using `Ex().check_function().check_args().has_equal_value()`.


### Changed

- Improvement in messages that are generated by default when checking `*args` and `**kwargs` arguments in function calls.

### Fixed

- You can now use `test_or()` inside `test_correct()`:

  ```python
  Ex().test_correct(
      check_object(...)
      test_or(
          check_function(...),
          has_equal_ast(...)
      )
  )
  ```


## 2.12.3

### Added

- Whether or not something should be highlighted can be specified through the state now
- You can use `<other_fun>.disable_highlighting().<anohter_fun>` anywhere in the SCT chain to disable highlighting.

### Changed

- There are no more `highlight` arguments in any pythonwhat SCT functions.
- `Feedback` now takes a state from which it reads which part should be highlighting and whether it should be highlighted.
- Use of `StubState` to trick the system somewhat, should be refactored at some point, but works fine.
- `test_function_v2()` and `test_function()` only higlight if the `index = 1`, i.e. when the first call of a certain function is being checked. Added tests (and updated other tests) accordingly.

## 2.12.2

### Added

- In `check_args()`, you can now use `['args', 0]` and `['kwargs', 'a']` to look for matched positional star args, and matched named star args.
  The docs have been updated accordingly: https://pythonwhat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/articles/checking_function_calls.html

### Changed

- The equality checks for lists, dicts, numpy arrays, pandas dataframes and pandas series have been made faster, without compromising backwards compatibility.

### Fixed

- There was a nasty bug with signature binding when using `check_function()` for the same function when this function took only positional args. This would alleviate the need of any `signature=False` usage, once and for all!

## 2.12.1

### Added

- Reference documentation now contains examples for `set_context()` and `set_env()`.
- A `tests/test_debug.py` file has been added to easily test questions that CDs might have.

### Changed

- There was a bug in the feedback message generation for errors. It now just refers to the console.


## 2.12.0

### Added

- All new `has_()` functions are now properly documented, so there should be no reason for you to use a `test_` function other than `test_or` and `test_correct`. If you do find yourself using it (because you don't know the alternative), ping me and we'll talk!
- Added documentation on the `check_function_def()` related functions.
- `index = 0` is now a default for functions like `check_if_else()`, `check_function()` etc.
- Like there is `set_context`, there is now `set_env` to set environment variables before using something like `has_equal_value()`. These `set_` functions serve as alternatives for the `extra_env` and `context_vals` arguments that appear in many functions and that I plan to discontinue at some point.
- Added a `test_` to `check_` article, that explains how you can go from old-style to new-style SCTs. Feel free to contribute!!

### Changed

- If you experiment locally, you will now see the feedback message that the SCT chain would generate (this is explained in the README on GitHub):

```Python
from pythonwhat.local import setup_state
s = setup_state(sol_code="x = 4", stu_code="x = 5")
s.check_object('x').has_equal_value()
# <traceback omitted>
# pythonwhat.Test.TestFail: Check the variable `x`. Unexpected expression value: expected `4`, got `5`.
```

- The glossary is featured more prominently in the docs, as it is a good resource to see how everything fits together.

### Removed

- There is no support for `keep_objs_in_env`, as nobody is using it.
