Checking function calls
-----------------------

Basic functionality
===================

Take the following example that checks whether a student used the ``round()`` function correctly:

.. code::

    # solution
    round(2.718282, ndigits = 3)

    # sct
    Ex().check_function("round").multi(
        check_args("number").has_equal_value(),
        check_args("ndigits").has_equal_value()
    )

    # submissions that pass:
    round(2.718282, 3)
    round(2.718282, ndigits = 3
    round(number=2.718282, ndigits=3)
    round(ndigits=3, number=2.718282)
    val=2.718282; dig=3; round(val, dig)
    val=2.718282; dig=3; round(number=val, dig)
    int_part = 2; dec_part = 0.718282; round(int_part + dec_part, 3)


- `check_function()` checks whether ``round()`` is called by the student, and parses all the arguments.
- ``check_args()`` checks whether a certain argument was specified, and zooms in on the expression used to specify that argument.
- ``has_equal_value()`` will rerun the expressions used to specify the arguments in both student and solution process, and compare the results.

.. note::

    In ``check_args()`` you can refer to the argument of a function call both by argument name and by position.

Customizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only want to check the ``number`` parameter, just don't include a second chain with ``check_args("ndigits")``:

.. code::

    Ex().check_function("round").check_args("number").has_equal_value()

If you only want to check whether the ``number`` parameter was specified, but not that it was specified correctly, drop ``has_equal_value()``:

.. code::

    Ex().check_function("round").check_args("number")

If you just want to check whether the function was called, drop ``check_args()``:

.. code::

    Ex().check_function("round")

If you want to compare the 'string versions' of the expressions used to set the arguments instead of the evaluated result of these expressions,
you can use ``has_equal_ast()`` instead of ``has_equal_value()``:

.. code:

    Ex().check_function("round").multi(
        check_args("number").has_equal_ast(),
        check_args("ndigits").has_equal_value()
    )

Now, the following submissions would fail:

- ``val=2.718282; dig=3; round(val, dig)`` -- the string representation of ``val`` in the student code is compared to ``2.718282`` in the solution code.
- ``val=2.718282; dig=3; round(number=val, dig)`` -- same
- ``int_part = 2; dec_part = 0.718282; round(int_part + dec_part, 3)`` -- the string representation of ``int_part + dec_part`` in the student code is compered to ``2.718282`` in the solution code.

As you can see, doing exact string comparison of arguments is not a good idea, as it is very inflexible.
There are cases, however, where it makes sense to use this, e.g. when there are very big objects passed to functions,
and you don't want to spend the processing power to fetch these objects from the student and solution processes.

Functions in packages
=====================

If you're testing whether function calls of particular packages are used correctly, you should always refer to these functions with their 'full name'.
Suppose you want to test whether the function ``show`` of ``matplotlib.pyplot`` was called, use this SCT:

.. code::

    Ex().check_function("matplotlib.pyplot.show")

``check_function()`` can handle it when a student used aliases for the python packages (all ``import`` and ``import * from *`` calls are supported).
If the student did not properly call the function, ``check_function()`` will automatically generate a feedback message that corresponds to how the student imported the modules/functions.

.. note:

    No matter how you import the function, you always have to refer to the function with its full name, e.g. ``package.subpackage1.subpackage2.function``.

Signatures
==========

The ``round()`` example earlier in this article showed that a student can call the function in a multitude of ways,
specifying arguments by position, by keyword or a mix of those. To be robust against this, pythonwhat uses the concept of argument binding.

More specifically, each function has a function signature. Given this signature and the way the function was called,
argument binding can map each parameter you specified to an argument. This small demo fetches the signature of the ``open`` function and tries to
bind arguments that have been specified in two different ways. Notice how the resulting bound arguments are the same:

.. code::

    >>> import inspect

    >>> sig = inspect.signature(open)

    >>> sig
    <Signature (file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)>

    >>> sig.bind('my_file.txt', mode = 'r')
    <BoundArguments (file='my_file.txt', mode='r')>

    >>> sig.bind(file = 'my_file.txt', mode = 'r')
    <BoundArguments (file='my_file.txt', mode='r')>


When you're using ``check_args()`` you are actually selecting these bound arguments.
This works fine for functions like ``round()`` and ``open()`` that have a list of named arguments,
but things get tricky when dealing with functions that take ``*args`` and ``*kwargs``.

``*args`` example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python allows functions to take a variable number of unnamed arguments through ``*args``, like this function:

.. code::

    def multiply(*args):
        res = 1
        for num in args:
            res *= num
        return res

Let's see what happens when different calls are bound to their arguments:

.. code::

    >>> import inspect

    >>> inspect.signature(multiply)
    <Signature (*args)>

    >>> sig = inspect.signature(multiply)

    >>> sig
    <Signature (*args)>

    >>> sig.bind(1, 2)
    <BoundArguments (args=(1, 2))>    

    >>> sig.bind(3, 4, 5)
    <BoundArguments (args=(3, 4, 5))>

Notice how now the list of arguments is grouped under a tuple with the name ``args`` in the bound arguments.
To be able to check each of these arguments individually, pythonwhat allows you to do repeated indexing in ``check_args()``.
Instead of specifying the name of an argument, you can specify a list of indices:

.. code::

    # solution to check against
    multiply(2, 3, 4)

    # corresponding SCT
    Ex().check_function("multiply").multi(
        check_args(["args", 0]).has_equal_value(),
        check_args(["args", 1]).has_equal_value(),
        check_args(["args", 2]).has_equal_value()
    )

The ``check_args()`` subchains each zoom in on a particular tuple element of the bound ``args`` argument.

``**kwargs`` example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python allows functions to take a variable number of named arguments through ``**kwargs``, like this function:

.. code::

    def my_dict(**kwargs):
        return dict(**kwargs)

Let's see what happens when different calls are bound to their arguments:

.. code::

    >>> import inspect

    >>> sig = inspect.signature(my_dict)

    >>> sig.bind(a = 1, b = 2)
    <BoundArguments (kwargs={'b': 2, 'a': 1})>

    >>> sig.bind(c = 2, b = 3)
    <BoundArguments (kwargs={'b': 3, 'c': 2})>

Notice how now the list of arguments is grouped under a dictionary name ``kwargs`` in the bound arguments.
To be able to check each of these arguments individually, pythonwhat allows you to do repeated indexing in ``check_args()``.
Instead of specifying the name of an argument, you can specify a list of indices:

.. code::

    # solution to check against
    my_dict(a = 1, b = 2)

    # corresponding SCT
    Ex().check_function("my_dict").multi(
        check_args(["kwargs", "a"]).has_equal_value(),
        check_args(["kwargs", "b"]).has_equal_value()
    )

The ``check_args()`` subchains each zoom in on a particular dictionary element of the bound ``kwargs`` argument.

Manual signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately for a lot of Python's built-in functions no function signature is readily available because the function has been implemented in C code.
To work around this, pythonwhat already includes manually specified signatures for functions such as ``print()``, ``str()``, ``hasattr()``, etc,
but it's still possible that some signatures are missing.

That's why ``check_function()`` features a ``signature`` parameter, that is ``True`` by default.
If pythonwhat can't retrieve a signature for the function you want to test,
you can pass an object of the class ``inspect.Signature`` to the ``signature`` parameter.

Suppose, for the sake of example, that ``check_function()`` can't find a signature for the ``round()`` function.
In a real situation, you will be informed about a missing signature through a backend error.
To be able to implement this SCT, you can use the ``sig_from_params()`` function:

.. code::

    sig = sig_from_params(param("number", param.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD),
                          param("ndigits", param.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD, default=0))
    Ex().check_function("round", signature=sig).multi(
        check_args("number").has_equal_value(),
        check_args("ndigits").has_equal_value()
    )

You can pass ``sig_from_params()`` as many parameters as you want.

``param`` is an alias of the ``Parameter`` class that's inside the ``inspect`` module.
- The first argument of ``param()`` should be the name of the parameter,
- The second argument should be the 'kind' of parameter. ``param.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD`` tells ``check_function`` that the parameter can be specified either through a positional argument or through a keyword argument.
Other common possibilities are ``param.POSITIONAL_ONLY`` and ``param.KEYWORD_ONLY`` (for a full list, refer to the `docs <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/inspect.html#inspect.Parameter>`_).
- The third optional argument allows you to specify a default value for the parameter.  

.. note:: 

    If you find vital Python functions that are used very often and that are not included in pythonwhat by default, you can `let us know <mailto:content-engineering@datacamp.com>`_ and we'll add the function to our `list of manual signatures <https://github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/blob/master/pythonwhat/signatures.py>`_.

Multiple function calls
=======================

Inside ``check_function()`` the ``index`` argument (``0`` by default), becomes important when there are several calls of the same function.
Suppose that your exercise requires the student to call the ``round()`` function twice: once on ``pi`` and once on Euler's number:

.. code::

    # Call round on pi
    round(3.14159, 3)

    # Call round on e
    round(2.71828, 3)

To test both these function calls, you'll need the following SCT:

.. code::

    Ex().check_function("round", 0).multi(
        check_args("number").has_equal_value()
        check_args("ndigits").has_equal_value()
    )
    Ex().check_function("round", 1).multi(
        check_args("number").has_equal_value()
        check_args("ndigits").has_equal_value()
    )

The first ``check_function()`` chain, where ``index=0``, looks for the first call of ``round()`` in both student solution code,
while ``check_funtion()`` with ``index=1`` will look for the second function call. After this, the rest of the SCT chain behaves as before.

Methods
=======

Methods are Python functions that are called on objects. For testing this, you can also use ``check_function()``.
Consider the following solution code, that creates a connection to an SQLite Database with ``sqlalchemy``.

.. code::

    # prep
    from urllib.request import urlretrieve
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table
    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')
    metadata = MetaData()
    connection = engine.connect()
    from sqlalchemy import select
    census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)
    stmt = select([census])

    # execute the query and fetch the results.
    connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()
    ```

To test the last chained method calls, you can use the following SCT.
Notice from the second ``check_function()`` call here that you have to describe the entire chain (leaving out the arguments that are passed to ``execute()``).
This way, you explicitly list the order in which the methods should have been called.

.. code::

    Ex().check_function("connection.execute").check_args("object")
    Ex().check_function("connection.execute.fetchall")

In the previous example, you might have noticed that ``check_function()`` was capable to infer that ``connection`` is a ``Connection`` object, and that ``execute()`` is a method of the ``Connection`` class.
For checking method calls that aren't chained, this is possible, but for chained method calls, such as ``connection.execute.fetchall``, this is not possible.
In those cases you'll have to manually specify a signature. With ``sig_from_obj()`` you can specify the function from which to extract a signature.

The following full example shows how it's done:

.. code::

    `@pre_exercise_code`
    ```{python}
    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd
    df = sns.load_dataset('tips')
    ```

    `@solution`
    ```{python}
    df.groupby(['tip', 'sex']).count()
    ```

    `@sct`
    ```{python}
    import pandas as pd
    sig = sig_from_obj(pd.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.count)
    Ex().check_function('df.groupby.count', signature = sig).has_equal_value()
    ```

In this example however, it wasn't really necessary to manually specify the signature,
as there are no arguments to check in the first place. Therefore, you might as well set ``signature``
to be ``False``, which skips the fetching of a signature and the binding or arguments altogether:

.. code::

    `@sct`
    ```{python}
    Ex().check_function('df.groupby.count', signature=False).has_equal_value()
    ```

**Watch out to do this as a one-stop solution to make your SCT run without errors:**
if there are arguments to check, argument binding makes sure that various ways of
calling the function can all work. Setting `signature=False` will skip this binding and your
SCT will not accept perfectly valid student submissions!

.. note::

    You can also use the ``sig_from_params()`` function to manually build the signature from scratch,
    but this this more work than simply specifying the function object as a string from which to extract the signature.
